    //         <p>Behind every painted face and every joyful shriek from the Kids Zone is a dedicated team of volunteers. This year, we're shining a spotlight on Sarah and Tom, the duo who have coordinated the children's activities for the past three years.</p>
    //         <p>"It's all about creating a safe and magical space for the kids," says Sarah. "Seeing their faces light up during the magic show or when they complete a craft is the best reward."</p>
    //         <p>Their planning starts months in advance, sourcing safe materials, coordinating with entertainers, and designing new games. "The biggest challenge is always coming up with new ideas," Tom adds, "but the energy on the day makes all the hard work worth it." We are so grateful for their tireless efforts!</p>
